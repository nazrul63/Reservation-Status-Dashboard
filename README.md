# Reservation Status Dashboard

Analyzed and visualized reservation data of an ariline by exrtracting, cleaning and transforming them to perform OLAP operations (Roll-Up, Slicing and Dicing) to obtain KPIs and improve business strategy. This helped to understand/find 

* performance of a route to the segment/leg level,
* transformation of resertvation from booking to being ticketed,
* Passenger Load Factor (PLF) in next day,7,15, and 30 day
* abnormal PLF deviation
* loopholes.

Ultimately aided in incorporating data-driven decisions, resulting in a remarkable increase in inventory utilization.
